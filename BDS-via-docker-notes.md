# project - BDS - via docker

I had this idea - to support client use of BDS (Brightspace Data Sets)
I could: set up an environment, using Docker containers.
Found some pre-built docker LAMP stack things, available on github.

So - had to learn to use git hub.
Adding these notes to my 'hello-world' github repo.

Have so far figured out how to 'edit' - clone - edit - pull request - merge (I think is the order of things) - and have now cloned two Brightspace repos: valence-sdk-php, and oauth2.0-client-example.

Next up: still not sure if I need to better understand, and be able to execute on OAuth2, or php, or?  what's next?

Perhaps now, getting the docker LAMP stack.  I figure I'll need to have that working, before 'tweaking' the php and - then finally, OAuth2.
